# SparkifyProject
## project motivation
this project is aimed to detect churn rates and their causes with a little bit of exploratory analysis in the spark data set

### project solution 
by using different classification ML models on top of them is random forest we are able to predict upcoming churn users
Note : this project has 3 dataset versions here i was using the 125 mb version

## libraries used:
pandas 
numpy
seaborn
pyspark.sql.functions ,pyspark.sql.types

## naming conventions:
- variables and objects were named based on python style while column names in the data frame followed the java style 
python style : df_scores_p
java style : dfScoresP

## room for improvments
more features could be used especially categorical variables 

## acknowledgments
udacity for providing such a unique dataset and the spark course
